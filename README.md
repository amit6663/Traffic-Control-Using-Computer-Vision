Welcome to Contributors.
A major problem in metropolitan areas is traffic.
Nowadays traffic density on the streets or lanes are increasing exponentially around the
world according to population increases. It causes several problems on the day to
day life of people. As we know that it is the era of speed so that
nobody wants to wait for a long time at any cost. Everybody don't
prefers to waste its time on traffic(appropriate time had given to projector and continuously
blowing the green light while lane is empty). This system
will tries to avoid the above issues. 
This problem can be resolved by
controlling the traffic density on the roads.
we try to build a dynamic traffic control system by measuring the traffic
density at the intersections by real time video feeds and image processing.
According to the measured density software provides delay time to the
microcontroller which controls the projector and thereby we
can give appropriate traffic signal to display.
